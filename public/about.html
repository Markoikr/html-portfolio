<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Marko, i'm an electric engeneering student from serbia and i'm 23 years old. From a very young age i developed
  passion for design in particular, and now when i'm older, i want to take it to the next level with web programming.
I have a lot of ideas that i wanna make work, so i gope this course will provide me with enough knowledge to pursue my dreams.

<p>My biggest hobbie is playing guitar. I'm a member of a heavy metal band from Belgrade called Havarija. I play solo guitar 
so i let the music speak instead of me. With it comes a lot of creativity which also reflects from my passion for web design.
Besides that i like playing sports, walking, hanging out with my friends and my girlfriend. All of that comes with a lot of 
time managing, because i go to two universities at the moment, that's why i like it all organised.
